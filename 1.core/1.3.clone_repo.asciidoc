Cloning a repo
--------------

- git clone
- git reset

In this section we're going to play with the contents of our repository by
deleting the content and seeing what our options are to recover from the
repository.

----
git clone https://github.com/ianmiell/shutit
cd shutit
ls .git
----

There's .git, just as before.

Recall the 4 stages of data in a git repo:

1) Local changes (working directory)
2) Staging/Adding/Index
3) Committing to local Repo
4) Pushing to remote

----
git log
git log --oneline
git log --oneline --graph
cd ..
mkdir tmpcopy
git clone ../folder
ls .git
rm -rf *
----

We have cloned the repository, and 'accidentally' deleting

----
ls .git          # The .git folder is still there
git status       # deleted in working tree/directory
git add .        # added to staging area
# oops!
git status
git reset --soft  # out of staging/index area, but still deleted!
git status
git reset --mixed # the default. does not change the working directory, but does the index
git status
git reset --hard  # does a re-check out of the whole repository, discarding working directory
git status
----

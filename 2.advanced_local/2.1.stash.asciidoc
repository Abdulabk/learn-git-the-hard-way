=== Git Stash

Next we introduce a concept that you may end up using a lot!

Often when you are working you want to return to a pristine state, but not lose
the work you have done so far.

Traditionally with other source control tools we've copied files changed locally
aside, then updated our repo, and diffed and re-applied the changed files.

However, git has a concept of the stash to store all local changes ready to
reapply at will.

Here is a basic example of a change I want to 'stash':

----
rm -rf 2.1.1
mkdir 2.1.1
cd 2.1.1
git init
echo 'Some content' > file1
git add file1
git commit -am initial
echo 'Some changes I'm not sure about' >> file1
----

You can get very sophisticated with the stash, but 99% of the time I use it like this:

----
[do some work]

[get interupted]

git stash

[deal with interruption]

git stash pop
----

Let's imagine I'm in the middle of some work, and Alice lets me know that 
there's an important update to the code I need to pull from BitBucket.

----
git diff
# diff --git a/file1 b/file1
# index 0ee3895..5554e0f 100644
# --- a/file1
# +++ b/file1
# @@ -1 +1,2 @@
#  Some content
# +Some changes I'm not sure about...
git stash
# Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 34509a0 initial
# HEAD is now at 34509a0 initial
git status
# On branch master
# nothing to commit, working directory clean
git log --graph --all --decorate

#       initial
----

As you can see, it's committed the state of the index (9ff...) and then
committed the local change to the refs/stash branch, and merged them as a child
of the HEAD.

Don't worry too much about the details: it's basically stored
all the changes we've made but not _committed_ ready to be re-applied.

'stash' is a special branch which is kept local to our repository. The message
'WIP on master' is added automatically for us.

The master branch is still where it was and the HEAD pointer is pointed at it
(that is where our repo now is).

I can now do my other work (in this case pulling the latest changes) without
concern for whether it conflicts with those changes. 

----
git stash list
# stash@{0}: WIP on master: 34509a0 initial
----

Once done, I can reapply those changes by running 'git stash pop':

----
git stash pop
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
# 	modified:   file1
# 
# no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
# Dropped refs/stash@{0} (279ee87c68798caaf2ea3d45fcfa0ac42df6ba4b)
----

which pops the change off the stash stack and restores me to where I was.

There are more sophisticated ways to deal with stash, but these are not covered
here.
